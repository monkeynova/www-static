# Refactoring Plan for `renderStaticBoardElements` in `ui.js`

To improve the `renderStaticBoardElements` function and make it more extensible for future rendering features, we will adopt an architecture based on **decomposition by responsibility** and **delegation**.

## Proposed Structure:

1.  **`renderStaticBoardElements(boardData)` (Main Orchestrator):**
    *   This function will be significantly simplified. Its primary responsibilities will be:
        *   Obtain computed CSS styles once at the beginning.
        *   Iterate through each tile on the board.
        *   For each tile, delegate the rendering to a new `renderTile(ctx, tileData, x, y, styles)` function.
        *   After the tile loop completes, draw the overall grid lines for the entire board.
        *   Finally, draw laser emitters (which are currently drawn after walls, maintaining their layering).

2.  **`renderTile(ctx, tileData, x, y, styles)` (Tile Renderer):**
    *   This new function will be responsible for drawing all visual elements *within the boundaries of a single tile*. It will delegate to further specialized functions:
        *   `drawTileBackground(ctx, tileData, x, y, styles)`: Responsible for drawing the base background color of the tile, determined by its `floorDevice.type`.
        *   `drawFloorDeviceVisuals(ctx, tileData, x, y, styles)`: This function will contain a `switch` statement or similar logic to call specific drawing functions for each type of floor device (e.g., `drawRepairStationSymbol`, `drawCheckpointVisuals`, `drawConveyorVisuals`, `drawHoleVisuals`, `drawGearVisuals`).
        *   `drawWallVisuals(ctx, tileData, x, y, styles)`: Dedicated to drawing the walls that are part of the current tile.
        *   `drawWallDeviceVisuals(ctx, tileData, x, y, styles)`: This function will iterate through `tileData.wallDevices` and call specific drawing functions for each type of wall-attached device (e.g., `drawLaserSymbol`, `drawPushPanelVisuals`).

3.  **Specialized Drawing Functions (e.g., `drawRepairStationSymbol`, `drawConveyorVisuals`, `drawPushPanelVisuals`, etc.):**
    *   These will be numerous, small, and highly focused functions. Each will be responsible for drawing only one specific visual element (e.g., a repair station symbol, conveyor stripes, a push panel).
    *   They will typically accept `ctx` (the canvas rendering context), `tileData` (the data for the current tile), `x`, `y` (the top-left pixel coordinates of the tile), and `styles` (the pre-computed CSS styles) as parameters.

## Benefits of this Architecture:

*   **Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity:** By breaking down the large `renderStaticBoardElements` function, the individual functions will have significantly fewer conditional branches and loops, making them easier to understand and test.
*   **Enhanced Modularity:** Adding new tile types, floor devices, or wall devices will primarily involve creating a new, small drawing function and adding a single call to it within the appropriate `renderTile`, `drawFloorDeviceVisuals`, or `drawWallDeviceVisuals` function. This minimizes changes to existing code.
*   **Improved Readability:** Function names will clearly indicate their purpose, making the rendering logic much more intuitive to follow.
*   **Easier Maintainability and Debugging:** Issues or desired changes related to a specific visual element can be isolated to its dedicated drawing function, reducing the risk of introducing bugs elsewhere.
*   **Better Testability:** Smaller, more focused functions are inherently easier to unit test.
